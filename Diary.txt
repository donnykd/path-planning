28/09/23 ~ Week 1: This week I have dabbled into learning pddl, chose a topic to model and write my plan with, which was aviation planning related, and I have finished my first draft abstract.

04/10/23 ~ Week 2: I have changed topics from aviation to exploration planning, researched about exploration planning, rewrote the abstract and finished the project plan.

12/10/23 ~ Week 3: Started experimenting with the existing pddl models online, started on my own exploration domain, created a unit test on a move left action and a simple plan. 

20/10/23 ~ Week 4: Had a meeting with Dr. Santiago yesterday for some guidance on my current progress and was given a reality check. Changed my approach on how I was modelling and now started to get good progress going. I aim to have a solid PDDL basis by the end of next week.

26/10/23 ~ Week 5: A busy week but I got a decent amount of work in, currently struggling on a final problem in PDDL before I switch to doing a bit of GDDL (which I plan on starting tomorrow) to get more progress done. Unfortunately I believe its just the limitations of PDDL, but I might be wrong. Will try to figure this out by the weekend or ill have to bring this up in my meeting I have booked for next tuesday.

01/11/23 ~ Week 6: Had another meeting with my supervisor yesterday. We talked about my project plan for a bit and had a discussion about how my end product should look. I raised my concerns about the project which were answered pretty well. I decided to drop GDDL and focus on creating a high level functioning path planning problem in a game environment. He also gave me some tips on how to write complex problems to test my code using python. My progress so far is pretty good.

06/11/23 ~ Week 7: I have not done much the past week unfortunately. Was busy with my other modules and found that I had close to no time for this project. I did do some research on fastdownward though and brainstormed some ideas to make this path planning problem a bit more complex. I plan to get a lot finished by the end of this week.

15/11/23 ~ Week 8: I have indeed finished a lot of work from my last entry in the diary. Most, if not all of my necessary actions are complete. I have prepared counts so I can try different search algorithms on my plans soon with fastdownward. All that is left is for me to create exhaustive plans to test all of my features together, which I shall generate through python. I have also commented most of my code and further refactored it. I will be doing this before the start of next week, so I can focus on interim report/presentation for the last 2 weeks.
