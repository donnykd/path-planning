28/09/23 ~ Week 1: This week I have dabbled into learning pddl, chose a topic to model and write my plan with, which was aviation planning related, and I have finished my first draft abstract.

04/10/23 ~ Week 2: I have changed topics from aviation to exploration planning, researched about exploration planning, rewrote the abstract and finished the project plan.

12/10/23 ~ Week 3: Started experimenting with the existing pddl models online, started on my own exploration domain, created a unit test on a move left action and a simple plan.
